# Stutrack
Stutrack is an open knowledge-sharing platform designed to help users record, organize, and share daily learnings, job tasks, or any other insights they wish to document. By providing a faster, more streamlined way to recap past experiences than traditional storage solutions, Stutrack empowers users to build a personal knowledge base that can be freely shared or monetized.

## Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure user registration and login, allowing users to create accounts, track their contributions, and personalize their experiences.

- **Add and Manage Learnings**  
  Record daily tasks, job-related insights, or personal learnings. Each entry can include images, tags, colors, a detailed description, GitHub resources, and external URLs for reference.

- **Flexible Content Access**  
  Users can choose to make their content freely available to the community or set it up for monetized access, supporting creators who rely on income from content creation.
